# Projet 5 Market Research Client behaviour.
Classification of client behaviour for makerting purposes, EDA, clustering, and rfm models.

# First step is in Exploration.
This is a step of EDA (explorative data analysis) and serves as a first look at the data. We explore the broad behaviour of clients across the main regions. We explore simple relationships and determine a rough shape of the challenges.

# Second step is Analysis.
This is the RFM model building, as well as tests of the most common clustering methods. We find that a composite method of both dbscan and kmeans to be the most interpretable and effective.

# Last step is Simulation.
This is a step to try to estimate the update rate of the model with new data. It is tested with cyclic ARI scoring.
